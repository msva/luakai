# LuaKai Color Scheme for NeoVim (Lua-only)

**Requires NVim 0.7+ (nvim_set_hl).**


Colors choice is mostly based on Molokai theme (by Tomas Restrepo) which in turn is based on (actually, mostly 1-to-1 port of) Monokai theme for TextMate by Wimer Hazenberg.


N.B.: cterm support is not yet finished (need to port values from vimL-like definitions which would otherwise redefine the non-cterm ones)
So, for now this theme is only compatible with GUI and terminal emulators that supports truecolor.
